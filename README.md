# XO Game 🤖❌⭕️

This is a simple XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game that I developed as part of my learning journey using **Flutter**.

## ✨ What I Did

- I built this app completely by myself as a **Junior Flutter Developer**.
- I added an **AI-based bot** that plays against the player.
- The bot's thinking logic was created using basic Artificial Intelligence rules like:
    - Trying to win if possible.
    - Blocking the player if they are about to win.
    - Playing in the center or corners when available.
- I got help from AI (ChatGPT) which explained how to build the bot logic step by step, and I implemented everything myself 💪.

## 📚 Technologies

- Flutter (Dart)
- Stateless & Stateful Widgets
- Game logic implementation
- AI decision making (rule-based)

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Make the bot smarter by learning from previous games.
- Add sound effects and animations.
- Add online multiplayer feature.
